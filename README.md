Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the use of principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software products.
The importance of software engineering is that it enhances product efficiency, quality, relaibility and scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968):
This conference marked the formal introduction of the term "software engineering." It highlighted the growing complexity of software development and the need for systematic approaches, leading to the establishment of software engineering as a distinct discipline.
Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s):
The Waterfall model became one of the first structured methodologies for software development. It provided a linear approach to project management, where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance) followed sequentially. This model set the stage for future methodologies and highlighted the importance of planning and documentation.
Agile Manifesto (2001):
The Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centric approaches. It shifted the focus from rigid processes to iterative development and adaptive planning, influencing countless teams and organizations to embrace Agile practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements gathering - collection of user needs and system requirements.
Design - development of system architecture according to user needs and system requirements.
Implementation - generation of code based on the design.
Testing - checking whether the software product works efficiently and meets the user needs.
Deployment - releasing of the software product to the users.
Maintenance - performing regular updates and bug fixes where necessary.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - generation of software solutions by writing and debugging code.
Quality Assurance Engineer - tests the developed software product and checks if it works efficiently and it is meets user needs.
Project Manager - oversees the development of the software product during the whole lifecycle.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The importance of IDEs is that it provides developers with a space where they can code, debug and test their programs to see whether they work. An example is Apache Netbeans.
The importance of VCS is that it provides developers with tools to enable them to work on the same project at the same time e.g collaboration. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technological debt.
Evolution of the user needs.
Timeframe within which a software product should be developed thus leading to generation of low quality products.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include using the agile methodology, tasks prioritization and effective communication between the developer and the user.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - it is the process of testing invidual components or modules.
Intergration testing - it is the process of testing the interaction between various modules or components.
System testing - it is the process of testing a system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - it is the process of testing the sysstem against user needs in order to see if it meets them.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of generating clear and concise questions or instructions in order to receive specific responses.
The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is that it maximizes the effectiveness of AI interactions, ensuring that users receive accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Give me a list of latest shows.
Clear, specific and concise prompt: Give me a list of reality TV shows released between January 2024 to September 2024.
It is evident that the improved prompt with specifically lead to a response of reality TV shows within a specified period while the vague prompt will lead to a general response with no specified timeline.
